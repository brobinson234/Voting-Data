# Voting-Data
Holding csv files and code for an investigation of voting at both the county (for President) and district (for Congress).

The goal of this project was to find the data myself, orient to what it contained, and then to go about visualizing the data in ways that I thought were interesting
and that demonstrated some key competencies. 

Each of the Jupyter Notebooks contains programs that take the state, the number of districts, and the dataset and return a series of graphs of Dem vs GOP votes in descending order
of total votes. There were a couple of interesitng finds. Most notably is that for congressional races, the GOP had bigger gains under Bush (00 and 04) then when Obama was 
running (08, 12). This goes against some often repeated assumptiosn that Obama polarized the GOP. It might more be the case that Obama polarized the GOP leadership and 
conservative media and this was then passed onto the base. This could also fit the emergence of the Tea Party which was a top-down organization.

In terms of county results, I was surprised at the number of places that were GOP strongholds, then went for Obama in 08, and then gradually or immediately slid back to the GOP.

Enjoy and let me know what you think!
